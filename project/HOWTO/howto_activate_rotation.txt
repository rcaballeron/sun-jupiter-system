hi roque,

the default values are 

new_rotation_flag = .false.
change_rotation_flag = .false.
change_initial_rotation_flag = .false.

for now, consider the first two controls.
to activate rotation 

change_rotation_flag = .true.
new_rotation_flag = .true.

to deactivate rotation after it has been turned on

change_rotation_flag = .true.
new_rotation_flag = .false.

to leave rotation in whatever on/off state it is in

change_rotation_flag = .false.

these two controls enable one to alter a model 
at the start of a run (./rn) or after a restart (./re). 
controls that only apply to the first model have ‘initial’ 
in their names and are ignored for restarts, for example
change_initial_rotation_flag.

there is also a family of controls that will automatically change the flags for you.
for example, to activate rotation when the model star is near the main-sequence:

! turn on rotation near zams
      near_zams_relax_omega_div_omega_crit = .true.  ! turn on rotation at zams
      num_steps_to_relax_rotation = 100              ! this number steps in the relaxation to the desired value   
      new_omega_div_omega_crit = 0.50d0              ! desired zams value of rotation
