abstract = {The radiative and particulate loss of mass by the Sun, -9.13*10{\^{}}-14 Solar masses per year or more causes the orbits of the planets to expand at the same rate, and their periods to lengthen at twice this rate. Unfortunately, under the present definition of the Astronomical Unit (AU) based on the fixed Gaussian gravity constant kGS = 0.01720209895 (AU){\^{}}1.5/day, the value AUmet of the AU in meters must decrease at 1/3 this rate, all these rates being expressed logarithmically. The progress of the planets along their orbits slows quadratically with time. For example, in one century Mercury would lag behind the position predicted using constant solar mass by almost 1.4 km, in two centuries 5.5 km. The value of AUmet can be made constant by redefining it, based on a reference solar mass unit, such as the solar mass at J2000; else, the solar Gaussian gravity constant kGS used in defining the AU could be redefined proportional to the square root of the solar mass. Improved accuracy of the ephemerides would impose useful bounds on losses due to axion emission (Sikivie 2005). With no axion emission the Earth's semi-major axis grows 1.37 m/cy; with the maximum allowable such emission the result is 1.57 m/cy. Under reasonable assumptions about alternate gravity theories, radar delay data are used to show that the effect of a changing Newtonian gravity constant is negligible.},

Classical hydrodynamic models predict that the solar interior must rotate highly differentially, in disagreement with observations. It has recently been shown that internal waves produced by convection in solar-type stars produce an asymmetric, shear layer oscillation, similar to Earth's quasi-biennial oscillation, that leads to efficient angular momentum redistribution from the core to the envelope. We present results of a model that successfully reproduces both the rotation profile and the surface abundance of lithium in solar-type stars of various ages.},

abstract = {Israelian et al. (2004) reported that exoplanet host stars are lithium depleted compared to solar-type stars without detected massive planets, a result recently confirmed by Gonzalez (2008). We investigate whether enhanced lithium depletion in exoplanet host stars may result from their rotational history. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow and fast solar-type rotators from the pre-main sequence (PMS) to the age of the Sun and compare them to the distribution of rotational periods observed for solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 5 Gyr. We show that slow rotators develop a high degree of differential rotation between the radiative core and the convective envelope, while fast rotators evolve with little core-envelope decoupling. We suggest that strong differential rotation at the base of the convective envelope is responsible for enhanced lithium depletion in slow rotators. We conclude that lithium-depleted exoplanet host stars were slow rotators on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) and argue that slow rotation results from a long lasting star-disk interaction during the PMS. Altogether, this suggests that long-lived disks ({\textgreater} 5 Myr) may be a necessary condition for massive planet formation/migration.},

@article{Baraffe2017,
abstract = {We study lithium depletion in low-mass and solar-like stars as a function of time, using a new diffusion coefficient describing extra-mixing taking place at the bottom of a convective envelope. This new form is motivated by multi-dimensional fully compressible, time implicit hydrodynamic simulations performed with the MUSIC code. Intermittent convective mixing at the convective boundary in a star can be modeled using extreme value theory, a statistical analysis frequently used for finance, meteorology, and environmental science. In this letter, we implement this statistical diffusion coefficient in a one-dimensional stellar evolution code, using parameters calibrated from multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a young low-mass star. We propose a new scenario that can explain observations of the surface abundance of lithium in the Sun and in clusters covering a wide range of ages, from {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 50 Myr to {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 4 Gyr. Because it relies on our physical model of convective penetration, this scenario has a limited number of assumptions. It can explain the observed trend between rotation and depletion, based on a single additional assumption, namely that rotation affects the mixing efficiency at the convective boundary. We suggest the existence of a threshold in stellar rotation rate above which rotation strongly prevents the vertical penetration of plumes and below which rotation has small effects. In addition to providing a possible explanation for the long standing problem of lithium depletion in pre-main sequence and main sequence stars, the strength of our scenario is that its basic assumptions can be tested by future hydrodynamic simulations.},

abstract = {Aims: The effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the surface abundances of solar-type stars are studied in order to investigate whether the reported difference in lithium content of exoplanet-host stars can be related to their rotational history. Moreover, the asteroseismic properties predicted for stars with and without exoplanets are compared to determine how such a scenario, which relates the lithium abundances and the rotational history of the star, can be further challenged by observations of solar-like oscillations. Methods: Based on observations of rotational periods of solar-type stars, slow rotators on the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) are modelled with a comprehensive treatment of only the shellular rotation, while fast rotators are modelled including both shellular rotation and magnetic fields. Assuming a possible link between low rotation rates on the ZAMS and the presence of planets as a result of a longer disc-locking phase during the pre-main sequence (PMS), we compare the surface abundances and asteroseismic properties of slow and fast rotating models, which correspond to exoplanet-host stars and stars without detected planets, respectively. Results: We confirm previous suggestions that the difference in the lithium content of stars with and without detected planets can be related to their different rotational history. The larger efficiency of rotational mixing predicted in exoplanet-host stars explains their lithium depletion and also leads to changes in the structure and chemical composition of the central stellar layers. Asteroseismic observations can reveal these changes and can help us distinguish between different possible explanations for the lower lithium content of exoplanet-host stars.},

abstract = {We examine the effects of diferent assumptions about the initial conditions, angular momentum loss law, and angular momentum transport on the angular momentum evolution of 0.5{\`{E}}1.2 solar mass stars. We Ðrst perform a parameter variation study to test the sensitivity of the surface rotation rate as a function of mass and age to changes in the initial conditions and input physics. We then check to see if the distribution of initial conditions for a given physical scenario is consistent for open clusters of di †er-ent ages. The behavior of the rapid rotators is highly sensitive to the saturation threshold for angular momentum loss above which angular momentum loss scales linearly with the rotation rate. Very high (u crit), values for suppress rapid rotation prior to the main sequence, and very low values permit rapid u crit rotation to survive for too long. For solid-body (SB) and di †erential rotation (DR) models, higher mass models rotate more rapidly than lower mass models for the same initial conditions and DR models u crit. di †er from SB models in both the direct e †ect of core-envelope decoupling and a change in the calibration of the angular momentum loss law needed to reproduce the solar rotation at the age of the Sun ; the e †ects of both are discussed. Slow rotation in young clusters can be achieved with modest disk lifetimes (3{\`{E}}10 Myr) for the DR models and longer disk lifetimes for the SB models (10 or more Myr). In addition, the slowly rotating DR models spin down during the early main sequence more than the slowly rotating SB models do. When compared with the cluster data, the observed mass dependence of the rapid rotator phenomenon can be reproduced only with a mass-dependent for both the SB and DR models. A scaling of u crit inversely proportional to the convective overturn timescale can reproduce the observed mass-u crit dependent spindown. The observed spindown of the slow rotators in the young open clusters is in better agreement with the DR than the SB models. We also discuss observational tests to distinguish di †erent classes of models using low-mass stars and rotation periods in open clusters.},

@article{Fuller2014,
abstract = {Recent asteroseismic advances have allowed for direct measurements of the internal rotation rates of many sub-giant and red giant stars. Unlike the nearly rigidly rotating Sun, these evolved stars contain radiative cores that spin faster than their overlying convective envelopes, but slower than they would in the absence of internal angular momentum transport. We investigate the role of internal gravity waves in angular momentum transport in evolving low mass stars. In agreement with previous results, we find that convectively excited gravity waves can prevent the development of strong differential rotation in the radiative cores of Sun-like stars. As stars evolve into sub-giants, however, low frequency gravity waves become strongly attenuated and cannot propagate below the hydrogen burning shell, allowing the spin of the core to decouple from the convective envelope. This decoupling occurs at the base of the sub-giant branch when stars have surface temperatures of roughly 5500 K. However, gravity waves can still spin down the upper radiative region, implying that the observed differential rotation is likely confined to the deep core near the hydrogen burning shell. The torque on the upper radiative region may also prevent the core from accreting high-angular momentum material and slow the rate of core spin-up. The observed spin-down of cores on the red giant branch cannot be totally attributed to gravity waves, but the waves may enhance shear within the radiative region and thus increase the efficacy of viscous/magnetic torques.},

abstract = {We present new models for the rotational evolution of solar-like stars between 1 Myr and 10 Gyr with the aim to reproduce the distributions of rotational periods observed for star forming regions and young open clusters within this age range. The models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetized stellar winds and specific dynamo and mass-loss prescriptions are adopted to tie angular momentum loss to angular velocity. The model additionally assume constant angular velocity during the disk accretion phase and allow for decoupling between the radiative core and the convective envelope as soon as the former develops. We have developed rotational evolution models for slow, median and fast rotators with initial periods of 10, 7, and 1.4d, respectively. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars between 1 Myr and 4.5 Gyr, including PMS to ZAMS spin up, prompt ZAMS spin down, and the early-MS convergence of surface rotation rates. We find the model parameters accounting for the slow and median rotators are very similar to each other, with a disk lifetime of 5 Myr and a core-envelope coupling timescale of 28-30 Myr. In contrast, fast rotators have both shorter disk lifetime (2.5 Myr) and core-envelope coupling timescale (12 Myr). We emphasize that these results are highly dependent on the adopted braking law. We also report a tentative correlation between initial rotational period and disk lifetime, which suggests that protostellar spin-down by massive disks in the embedded phase is at the origin of the initial dispersion of rotation rates in young stars. We conclude that this class of semi-empirical models successfully grasp the main trends of the rotational behaviour of solar-type stars as they evolve and make specific predictions that may serve as a guide for further development.},

abstract = {We study the predicted rotational evolution of solar-type stars from the pre-main sequence to the solar age with 1D rotating evolutionary models including physical ingredients. We computed rotating evolution models of solar-type stars including an external stellar wind torque and internal transport of angular momentum following the method of Maeder and Zahn with the code STAREVOL. We explored different formalisms and prescriptions available from the literature. We tested the predictions of the models against recent rotational period data from extensive photometric surveys, lithium abundances of solar-mass stars in young clusters, and the helioseismic rotation profile of the Sun. We find a best-matching combination of prescriptions for both internal transport and surface extraction of angular momentum. This combination provides a very good fit to the observed evolution of rotational periods for solar-type stars from early evolution to the age of the Sun. Additionally, we show that fast rotators experience a stronger coupling between their radiative region and the convective envelope. Regardless of the set of prescriptions, however, we cannot simultaneously reproduce surface angular velocity and the internal profile of the Sun or the evolution of lithium abundance. We confirm the idea that additional transport mechanisms must occur in solar-type stars until they reach the age of the Sun. Whether these processes are the same as those needed to explain recent asteroseismic data in more advanced evolutionary phases is still an open question.},

We investigate the lithium content of young low-mass stars in the 5 Myr old, star forming region NGC 2264 and its relationship with rotation. Methods. We combine lithium equivalent width measurements (EW(Li)) from the Gaia-ESO Survey with the determination of rotational periods from the CSI 2264 survey. We only consider bona fide nonaccreting cluster members to minimize the uncertainties on EW(Li). Results. We report the existence of a relationship between lithium content and rotation in NGC 2264 at an age of 5 Myr. The Li-rotation connection is seen over a restricted temperature range (T eff = 3800-4400 K), where fast rotators are Li-rich compared to slow rotators. This correlation is similar to, albeit of lower amplitude than, the Li-rotation connection previously reported for K dwarfs in the 125 Myr old Pleiades cluster. We investigate whether the nonstandard pre-main-sequence models developed so far to explain the Pleiades results, which are based on episodic accretion , pre-main-sequence, core-envelope decoupling, and/or radius inflation due to enhanced magnetic activity, can account for early development of the Li-rotation connection. While radius inflation appears to be the most promising possibility, each of these models has issues. We therefore also discuss external causes that might operate during the first few Myr of pre-main-sequence evolution, such as planet engulfment and/or steady disk accretion, as possible candidates for the common origin for Li excess and fast rotation in young low-mass pre-main-sequence stars. Conclusions. The emergence of a connection between lithium content and rotation rate at such an early age as 5 Myr suggests a complex link between accretion processes, early angular momentum evolution, and possibly planet formation, which likely impacts early stellar evolution and has yet to be fully deciphered.},

abstract = {We examine the internal structure of solar-like stars in detail between 0.8 and 1.4M Sun and during pre-main sequence phase. Recent opacity computations of OPAL along with a new hydrodynamical mixing process have been considered. We also introduce up-to-date nuclear reaction rates and explore the impact of accretion, mixing-length parameter, non-solar distributions among metals and realistic rotation history. We compare models predictions of lithium depletion to the {\$}{\^{}}7Li{\$} content observations of the Sun and to 4 young clusters of different metallicities and ages. We show that we can distinguish two phases in lithium depletion: 1- a rapid nuclear destruction in the T-Tauri phase before 20 Myrs : this is independent of the mass used within our range but largely dependent on the extension and temperature of the convective zone, 2- a second phase where the destruction is slow and moderate and which is largely dependent on the (magneto)hydrodynamic instability located at the base of the convective zone. In terms of composition, we show the interest on considering helium and especially the mixture of heavy elements : carbon, oxygen, silicium and iron. We outline the importance of O/Fe ratio. We note a reasonable agreement on lithium depletion for the two best known cases, the Sun and the Hyades cluster for solar-like stars. Other clusters suggest that processes which may partly inhibit the predicted premainsequence depletion cannot be excluded, in particular for stars below {\~{}} 0.9M Sun. Finally we suggest different research areas such as initial stellar models and more realistic atmospheres which could contribute to a better understanding of this early phase of evolution and which should become the object of subsequent research.},

abstract = {This paper examines the outflows associated with the interaction of a stellar magnetosphere with an accretion disk. In particular, we investigate the magnetospheric ejections (MEs) due to the expansion and reconnection of the field lines connecting the star with the disk. Our aim is to study the dynamical properties of the outflows and evaluate their impact on the angular momentum evolution of young protostars. Our models are based on axisymmetric time-dependent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of the dipolar magnetosphere of a rotating protostar with a viscous and resistive disk, using alpha prescriptions for the transport coefficients. Our simulations are designed in order to model: the accretion process and the formation of accretion funnels; the periodic inflation/reconnection of the magnetosphere and the associated MEs; the stellar wind. Similarly to a magnetic slingshot, MEs can be powered by the rotation of both the disk and the star so that they can efficiently remove angular momentum from both. Depending on the accretion rate, MEs can extract a relevant fraction of the accretion torque and, together with a weak but non-negligible stellar wind torque, can balance the spin-up due to accretion. When the disk truncation approaches the corotation radius, the system enters a "propeller" regime, where the torques exerted by the disk and the MEs can even balance the spin-up due to the stellar contraction. The MEs spin-down efficiency can be compared to other scenarios, such as the Ghosh {\&} Lamb, X-wind or stellar wind models. Nevertheless, for all scenarios, an efficient spin-down torque requires a rather strong dipolar component, which has been seldom observed in classical T Tauri stars. A better analysis of the torques acting on the protostar must take into account non-axisymmetric and multipolar magnetic components consistent with observations.},

We use literature data on the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main sequence star measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very strong fields on these stars which decreases the efficiency with which gas motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona.},

abstract = {Rotational shear layers at the boundary between radiative and convective zones, tachoclines, play a key role in the process of magnetic field generation in solar-like stars. We present two sets of global simulations of rotating turbulent convection and dynamo. The first set considers a stellar convective envelope only; the second one, aiming at the formation of a tachocline, considers also the upper part of the radiative zone. Our results indicate that the resulting mean-flows and dynamo properties like the growth rate, saturation energy and mode depend on the Rossby (Ro) number. For the first set of models either oscillatory (with {\~{}}2 yr period) or steady dynamo solutions are obtained. The models in the second set naturally develop a tachocline which, in turn, leads to the generation of strong mean magnetic field. Since the field is also deposited into the stable deeper layer, its evolutionary time-scale is much longer than in the models without a tachocline. Surprisingly, the magnetic field in the upper turbulent convection zone evolves in the same time scale as the deep field. These models result in either an oscillatory dynamo with {\~{}}30 yr period or in a steady dynamo depending on Ro. In terms of the mean-field dynamo coefficients computed using FOSA, the field evolution in the oscillatory models without a tachocline seems to be consistent with dynamo waves propagating according to the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule. In the models with tachoclines the dynamics is more complex involving other transport mechanisms as well as tachocline instabilities.},

abstract = {We develop a model based on three dimensional mean-field magnetohydrodynamics computations for the generation of large scale magnetic fields in fully convective objects like low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and possibly gaseous planets. The dynamo process is of $\alpha$ 2 type and thus differs from the shell-dynamo at work in more massive stars. The $\alpha$ 2 dynamo is found to become supercritical for Coriolis numbers Ω {\textgreater} ∼ 1, i.e. Rossby numbers Ro {\textless} ∼ 10. It generates a large-scale, non-axisymmetric, steady field that is symmetric with respect to the equatorial plane. Saturation of the $\alpha$ 2-generated field at the equipartition field strength yields strengths of several kiloGauss, in agreement with observations of active M dwarfs, and provides a qualitative explanation for the observed activity saturation in late M stars. For brown dwarfs with a conductive core, as occurs at the center of the most massive and oldest of these objects, we have also studied an $\alpha$ 2 Ω dynamo, i.e. the effect of differential rotation. In this case the field is predominantly toroidal, axisymmetric, and oscillatory, like the solar magnetic field. The topology of the field in the fully convective objects exhibits a high order multipole character that differs from the aligned dipole field generated by the $\alpha$Ω dynamo. The strong reduction of the dipolar component due to the non-axisymmetry of the field should considerably reduce the Alfven radius and thus the efficiency of magnetic braking, providing an appealing explanation for the decreasing angular momentum loss rate observed in low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. This may have also implications for cataclysmic variables below the period gap. In spite of this large-scale field, the decreasing conductivity in the dominantly neutral atmosphere of these objects may prevent the current generation necessary to support a chromosphere and thus activity. An observational signature of the present model would be (i) asymmetry of the chromospheric activity, contrary to the spatially uniform activity expected from small-scale turbulent dynamo and (ii) the absence of cycles in uniformly rotating (fully convective) low-mass objects.},

The consequence is that the interplay of the thermal and magnetic instabilities favours the chemical transport of elements, while there would be no transport in models with magnetic field only.

abstract = {Aims: We study the influence of rotation and disc lifetime on lithium depletion of pre-main sequence (PMS) solar-type stars. Methods: The impact of rotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithium abundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating PMS models that include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. The influence of the disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of PMS rotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phase between 3 and 9 Myr. Results: The surface lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is decreased when rotational effects are included. During the beginning of the lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work. This results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating models compared to non-rotating ones. When the convective envelope recedes from the stellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due to differential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. This mixing results in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limited contribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithium depletion during the second part of the PMS evolution. The impact of rotation on PMS lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of the disc-locking phase. When the disc lifetime increases, the PMS lithium abundance of a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotational mixing in the radiative zone. A relationship between the surface rotation and lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is then obtained: slow rotators on the zero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fast rotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime.},

We determine the occurrence and properties of these convection zones as function of the stellar parameters. We then confront our results with observations of OB stars. Methods. A stellar evolution code is used to compute a grid of massive star models at different metallicities. In these models, the mixing length theory is used to characterize the envelope convection zones. Results. We find the iron convection zone (FeCZ) to be more prominent for lower surface gravity, higher luminosity and higher initial metallicity. It is absent for luminosities below about 10 3.2 L ⊙ , 10 3.9 L ⊙ , and 10 4.2 L ⊙ for the Galaxy, LMC and SMC, respectively. We map the strength of the FeCZ on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for three metallicities, and compare this with the occurrence of observational phenomena in O stars: microturbulence, non-radial pulsations, wind clumping, and line profile variability. Conclusions. The confirmation of all three trends for the FeCZ as function of stellar parameters by empirical microturbulent velocities argues for a physical connection between sub-photospheric convective motions and small scale stochastic velocities in the photosphere of O-and B-type stars. We further suggest that clumping in the inner parts of the winds of OB stars could be caused by the same mechanism, and that magnetic fields produced in the FeCZ could appear at the surface of OB stars as diagnosed by discrete absorption components in ultraviolet absorption lines.},

In the present paper we focus on a detailed investigation of MS Li depletion and its time scales for stars in the 6350-5500 K effective temperature range. For the first time, we were able to constrain the age at which non-standard mixing processes, driving MS Li depletion, appear. We have also shown that MS Li depletion is not a continuous process and cannot be simply described by a t{\^{}}(-alpha) law. We confirm that depletion becomes ineffective beyond an age of 1-2 Gyr for the majority of the stars, leading to a Li plateau at old ages. We compared the empirical scenario of Li as a function of age with the predictions of three non-standard models. We found that models including only gravity waves as main mixing process are not able to fit the Li vs. age pattern and thus this kind of mixing can be excluded as the predominant mechanism responsible for Li depletion. On the other hand, models including slow mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum loss, and in particular those including also diffusive processes not related to rotation, can explain to some extent the empirical evidence. However, none of the currently proposed models can fit the plateau at old ages.},

abstract = {We substantially update the capabilities of the open source software package Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and its one-dimensional stellar evolution module, MESAstar. Improvements in MESAstar's ability to model the evolution of giant planets now extends its applicability down to masses as low as one-tenth that of Jupiter. The dramatic improvement in asteroseismology enabled by the space-based Kepler and CoRoT missions motivates our full coupling of the ADIPLS adiabatic pulsation code with MESAstar. This also motivates a numerical recasting of the Ledoux criterion that is more easily implemented when many nuclei are present at non-negligible abundances. This impacts the way in which MESAstar calculates semi-convective and thermohaline mixing. We exhibit the evolution of 3-8 M stars through the end of core He burning, the onset of He thermal pulses, and arrival on the white dwarf cooling sequence. We implement diffusion of angular momentum and chemical abundances that enable calculations of rotating-star models, which we compare thoroughly with earlier work. We introduce a new treatment of radiation-dominated envelopes that allows the uninterrupted evolution of massive stars to core collapse. This enables the generation of new sets of supernovae, long gamma-ray burst, and pair-instability progenitor models. We substantially modify the way in which MESAstar solves the fully coupled stellar structure and composition equations, and we show how this has improved the scaling of MESA's calculational speed on multi-core processors. Updates to the modules for equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmospheric boundary conditions are also provided. We describe the MESA Software Development Kit that packages all the required components needed to form a unified, maintained, and well-validated build environment for MESA. We also highlight a few tools developed by the community for rapid visualization of MESAstar results.},

abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our understanding of the formation, structure and evolution of both the Sun and our solar system. Furthermore, it is an essential reference standard against which the elemental contents of other astronomical objects are compared. In this review we evaluate the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition. In particular, we present a re-determination of the abundances of nearly all available elements, using a realistic new 3-dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for departures from LTE whenever possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and neon compared with the widely-used values of a decade ago. The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree of internal consistency between available abundance indicators, and by agreement with values obtained in the solar neighborhood and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find a satisfactory resolution.},

We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the STELLA radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernova properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernovae, pulsational pair-instability supernovae, and the formation of stellar-mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability to import multidimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA.

abstract = {The rapidly rotating cool dwarfs of the Pleiades are rich in lithium relative to their slowly rotating counterparts. Motivated by observations of inflated radii in young, active stars, and by calculations showing that radius inflation inhibits pre-main sequence (pre-MS) Li destruction, we test whether this pattern could arise from a connection between stellar rotation rate and radius inflation on the pre-MS. We demonstrate that pre-MS radius inflation can efficiently suppress lithium destruction by rotationally induced mixing in evolutionary models, and that the net effect of inflation and rotational mixing is a pattern where rotation correlates with lithium abundance for {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}} {\textless} {\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, and anti-correlates with lithium abundance for {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}} {\textgreater} {\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, similar to the empirical trend in the Pleiades. Next, we adopt different prescriptions for the dependence of inflation on rotation, and compare their predictions to the Pleiades lithium/rotation pattern. We find that if a connection between rotation and radius inflation exists, then the important qualitative features of this pattern naturally and generically emerge in our models. This is the first consistent physical model to date that explains the Li--rotation correlation in the Pleiades. We discuss plausible mechanisms for inducing this correlation and suggest an observational test using granulation.},

abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn {\&} Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60 M with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (Ω) increases from 0 to 90{\%} of the surface critical velocity (Ω crit), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60 M) are increased by 1 to 2{\%}. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5 M smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the µ−gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of µ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing inoperant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.

abstract = {A comparison of the Ca + emission luminosity-after correction for spectral-type effects-for the Pleiades, Ursa Major, and Hyades stars and the Sun indicate an emission decay which varies as the inverse square root of the age. Further, the rotational decay curve is found to satisfy the same law. It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially. Since Ca + emission is linearly proportional to magnetic field strength at the surface, one can predict that the surface fields are proportional to angular velocity and decay as the inverse square root. The above results are predicated on the standard Hyades age (0.4 billion years). In an effort to put the relation between stellar age and the intensity of emission reversal of the Ca + K-and H-lines (Wilson 1963; Wilson and Skumanich 1964) on a quantitative basis the author has reduced photoelectric observations of the cores of the K-and H-lines in the field stars (Wilson 1968), the Hyades (Wilson 1970), and the Sun (Wilson 1971) to a common spectral type (specifically, to B-F = 0.60). As Wilson (1970) has shown, K and H emission varies, for a given age group, with spectral type, so any meaningful age relation must be discussed after temperature differences are removed. The details of this procedure will be given elsewhere; our intent here is to compare the resulting (Ca + emission, age)-relation with that for rotational braking and lithium depletion. In Figure 1 the temperature-corrected Ca" 1 " emission luminosity is plotted (after subtraction of the "zero" point flux as given by the lower envelope of Wilson's flux data) for the Sun and for the Hyades and Ursa Major stars. The latter are to be found among Wilson's field-star data. The Hyades emission luminosity is taken as unity at all spectral types. Also plotted are the Ca + emission data for the Pleiades as estimated from Kraft and Greenstein's (1969) equivalent-width measures of the late-type stars in the Pleiades and Hyades. The indicated errors are based on the spread in data. The figure indicates an inverse square-root law for the decay of Ca + emission. Also plotted in Figure 1 are average equatorial velocities for the G stars in the Pleiades and Hyades and for the Sun (Kraft 1967 ; cf. Conti 1968 for further references of the data used). It is evident that the rotational data are in a constant proportion, within experimental errors, with the Ca + emission data; i.e., the rotational decay also follows a square-root relation. The same can be said for the lithium-abundance data (for a review of this data, see van den Heuvel and Conti 1971) except that here the Sun has an overdepletion. It would appear that the lithium depletion follows the rotational and Ca + emission decay through times of the order of the Hyades age and then proceeds exponentially with a e-folding time of 1.1 X 10 9 years. Alternately, the lithium abundance in the Sun may be underestimated by a factor of 10. According to Frazier's data (Frazier 1970), Ca + emission intensity, in a 1.1 {\^{A}} band centered on the K-line, varies linearly with surface magnetic field strength. Thus it is appropriate to identify the stellar Ca + emission luminosity with the (average) surface magnetic field. Figure 1 then implies that the average surface (dynamo) field is pro-* The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation. 565},

It has become evident that massive star evolution is very diverse, being sensitive to metallicity, binarity, rotation, and possibly magnetic fields. While the problem to obtain a good statistical observational database is alleviated by current large spectroscopic surveys, it remains a challenge to model these diverse paths of massive stars towards their violent end stage. We show that the main sequence stage offers the best opportunity to gauge the relevance of the various possible evolutionary scenarios. This also allows to sketch the post-main sequence evolution of massive stars, for which observations of Wolf-Rayet stars give essential clues. Recent supernova discoveries due to the current boost in transient searches allow tentative mappings of progenitor models with supernova types, including pair instability supernovae and gamma-ray bursts.},

abstract = {We examine the angular momentum loss and associated rotational spindown for magnetic hot stars with a line-driven stellar wind and a rotation-aligned dipole magnetic field. Our analysis here is based on our previous 2-D numerical MHD simulation study that examines the interplay among wind, field, and rotation as a function of two dimensionless parameters, one characterizing the wind magnetic confinement ({\$}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} \backslashequiv B{\_}{\{}eq{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}} R{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}/{\{}\backslashdot M{\}} v{\_}{\{}\backslashinfty{\}}{\$}), and the other the ratio ({\$}W \backslashequiv V{\_}{\{}rot{\}}/V{\_}{\{}orb{\}}{\$}) of stellar rotation to critical (orbital) speed. We compare and contrast the 2-D, time variable angular momentum loss of this dipole model of a hot-star wind with the classical 1-D steady-state analysis by Weber and Davis (WD), who used an idealized monopole field to model the angular momentum loss in the solar wind. Despite the differences, we find that the total angular momentum loss {\$}{\{}\backslashdot J{\}}{\$} averaged over both solid angle and time follows closely the general WD scaling {\$}{\{}\backslashdot J{\}} = (2/3) {\{}\backslashdot M{\}} \backslashOmega R{\_}{\{}A{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}, where {\$}{\{}\backslashdot M{\}}{\$} is the mass loss rate, {\$}\backslashOmega{\$} is the stellar angular velocity, and {\$}R{\_}{\{}A{\}}{\$} is a characteristic Alfv$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}n radius. However, a key distinction here is that for a dipole field, this Alfv$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}}n radius has a strong-field scaling {\$}R{\_}{\{}A{\}}/R{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} \backslashapprox \backslasheta{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\^{}}{\{}1/4{\}}{\$}, instead of the scaling {\$}R{\_}{\{}A{\}}/R{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} \backslashsim \backslashsqrt{\{}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\}}{\$} for a monopole field. This leads to a slower stellar spindown time that in the dipole case scales as {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}spin{\}} = \backslashtau{\_}{\{}mass{\}} 1.5k/\backslashsqrt{\{}\backslasheta{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}mass{\}} \backslashequiv M/{\{}\backslashdot M{\}}{\$} is the characteristic mass loss time, and {\$}k{\$} is the dimensionless factor for stellar moment of inertia. The full numerical scaling relation we cite gives typical spindown times of order 1 Myr for several known magnetic massive stars.},

abstract = {Magnetic fields at the surface of a few early-type stars have been directly detected. These fields have magnitudes between a few hundred G up to a few kG. In one case, evidence of magnetic braking has been found. We investigate the effects of magnetic braking on the evolution of rotating ({\$}\backslashupsilon{\_}{\{}\backslashrm ini{\}}{\$}=200 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) 10 M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} stellar models at solar metallicity during the main-sequence (MS) phase. The magnetic braking process is included in our stellar models according to the formalism deduced from 2D MHD simulations of magnetic wind confinement by ud-Doula and co-workers. Various assumptions are made regarding both the magnitude of the magnetic field and of the efficiency of the angular momentum transport mechanisms in the stellar interior. When magnetic braking occurs in models with differential rotation, a strong and rapid mixing is obtained at the surface accompanied by a rapid decrease in the surface velocity. Such a process might account for some MS stars showing strong mixing and low surface velocities. When solid-body rotation is imposed in the interior, the star is slowed down so rapidly that surface enrichments are smaller than in similar models with no magnetic braking. In both kinds of models (differentially or uniformly rotating), magnetic braking due to a field of a few 100 G significantly reduces the angular momentum of the core during the MS phase. This reduction is much greater in solid-body rotating models.},

abstract = {We present a description for the angular momentum loss rate due to magnetic braking for late type stars taking into account recent observational data on the relationship between stellar activity and rotation. The analysis is based on an idealized two component coronal model subject to constraints imposed on the variation of the coronal gas density with rotation period inferred from the observed variation of X-ray luminosity, L{\_}x, with rotation rate, Omega, (L{\_}x $\backslash$propto Omega{\^{}}2) for single rotating dwarfs. An application of the model to high rotation rates leads to a gradual turnover of the X-ray luminosity which is similar to the saturation recently observed in rapidly rotating dwarfs. The resulting angular momentum loss rate, $\backslash$dot J, depends on Omega in the form $\backslash$dot J $\backslash$propto Omega{\^{}}beta where beta {\~{}} 3 for slow rotators and {\~{}} 1.3 for fast rotators. The relation at high rotation rates significantly differs from the power law exponent for slowly rotating stars, depressing the angular momentum loss rate without necessarily requiring the saturation of the magnetic field. The application of this model to the evolution of cataclysmic variable binary systems leads to mass transfer rates that are in approximate accord with those observed in comparison to rates based on either a Skumanich law or an empirical law based on beta=1.},

In the present paper we focus on a detailed investigation of MS Li depletion and its time scales for stars in the 6350-5500 K effective temperature range. For the first time, we were able to constrain the age at which non-standard mixing processes, driving MS Li depletion, appear. We have also shown that MS Li depletion is not a continuous process and cannot be simply described by a t{\^{}}(-alpha) law. We confirm that depletion becomes ineffective beyond an age of 1-2 Gyr for the majority of the stars, leading to a Li plateau at old ages. We compared the empirical scenario of Li as a function of age with the predictions of three non-standard models. We found that models including only gravity waves as main mixing process are not able to fit the Li vs. age pattern and thus this kind of mixing can be excluded as the predominant mechanism responsible for Li depletion. On the other hand, models including slow mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum loss, and in particular those including also diffusive processes not related to rotation, can explain to some extent the empirical evidence. However, none of the currently proposed models can fit the plateau at old ages.},

Key results from a long running campaign aimed at characterising the large scale magnetic fields in accreting T Tauri stars are presented. Maps of surface magnetic flux in these systems can be used to build 3-D models exploring the role of magnetic fields and the efficiency with which magnetic fields can channel accretion from circumstellar disks on to young stars. Long-term variability in T Tauri star magnetic fields strongly point to a dynamo origin of the magnetic fields. Studies are underway to quantify how changes in magnetic fields affect their accretion properties. We also present the first results from a new programme that investigates the evolution of magnetic fields in intermediate mass (1.5-3 Msun) pre-main sequence stars as they evolve from being convective T Tauri stars to fully radiative Herbig AeBe stars.},

A magnetic instability in the toroidal field (wound up by differential rotation) replaces the role of convection in closing the field amplification loop. Tayler instability is likely to be the most relevant magnetic instability. A dynamo model is developed from these ingredients, and applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. It produces a predominantly horizontal field. This dynamo process is found to be more effective in transporting angular momentum than the known hydrodynamic mechanisms. It might account for the observed pattern of rotation in the solar core.},

abstract = {We review the properties of solar magneto-convection in the top half of the convection zones scale heights (from 20 Mm below the visible surface to the surface, and then through the photosphere to the temperature minimum). Convection is a highly non-linear and non-local process, so it is best studied by numerical simulations. We focus on simulations that include sufficient detailed physics so that their results can be quantitatively compared with observations. The solar surface is covered with magnetic features with spatial sizes ranging from unobservably small to hundreds of megameters. Three orders of magnitude more magnetic flux emerges in the quiet Sun than emerges in active regions. In this review we focus mainly on the properties of the quiet Sun magnetic field. The Sun's magnetic field is produced by dynamo action throughout the convection zone, primarily by stretching and twisting in the turbulent downflows. Diverging convective upflows and magnetic buoyancy carry magnetic flux toward the surface and sweep the field into the surrounding downflow lanes where the field is dragged downward. The result is a hierarchy of undulating magnetic $\Omega$-and {\'{i}} µ{\'{i}}±-loops of different sizes. New magnetic flux first appears at the surface in a mixed polarity random pattern and then collects into isolated unipolar regions due to underlying larger scale magnetic structures. Rising magnetic structures are not coherent, but develop a filamentary structure. Emerging magnetic flux alters the convection properties, producing larger, darker granules. Strong field concentrations inhibit transverse plasma motions and, as a result, reduce con-vective heat transport toward the surface which cools. Being cooler, these magnetic field concentrations have a shorter scale height and become evacuated. The field becomes further compressed and can reach strengths in balance with the surrounding gas pressure. Because of their small internal density, photons escape from deeper in the atmosphere. Narrow evacuated field concentrations get heated from their hot sidewalls and become brighter than their surroundings. Wider magnetic concentrations are not heated so they become darker, forming pores and sunspots.

For this system, as well as for a large fraction of other well-studied LMXBs, the observationally-inferred mass accretion rate is known to strongly exceed the theoretically expected mass transfer rate. We suggest that this discrepancy can be solved by applying a modified magnetic braking prescription, which accounts for increased wind mass loss in evolved stars compared to main sequence stars. Using our mass transfer framework based on {\{}$\backslash$tt MESA{\}}, we explore a large range of binaries at the onset of the mass transfer. We identify the subset of binaries for which the mass transfer tracks cross the Sco X-1 values for the mass ratio and the orbital period. We confirm that no solution can be found for which the standard magnetic braking can provide the observed accretion rates, while wind-boosted magnetic braking can provide the observed accretion rates for many progenitor binaries that evolve to the observed orbital period and mass ratio.},

abstract = {First, we review the main physical effects to be considered in the building of evolutionary models of rotating stars on the Upper Main-Sequence (MS). The internal rotation law evolves as a result of contraction and expansion, meridional circulation, diffusion processes and mass loss. In turn, differential rotation and mixing exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion, so that a consistent treatment is necessary. We review recent results on the evolution of internal rotation and the surface rotational velocities for stars on the Upper MS, for red giants, supergiants and W-R stars. A fast rotation is enhancing the mass loss by stellar winds and reciprocally high mass loss is removing a lot of angular momentum. The problem of the ``break-up'' or {\$}\backslashOmega{\$}-limit is critically examined in connection with the origin of Be and LBV stars. The effects of rotation on the tracks in the HR diagram, the lifetimes, the isochrones, the blue to red supergiant ratios, the formation of W-R stars, the chemical abundances in massive stars as well as in red giants and AGB stars, are reviewed in relation to recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The effects of rotation on the final stages and on the chemical yields are examined, as well as the constraints placed by the periods of pulsars. On the whole, this review points out that stellar evolution is not only a function of mass M and metallicity Z, but of angular velocity {\$}\backslashOmega{\$} as well.},

MESA star solves the fully coupled structure and composition equations simultaneously. It uses adaptive mesh refinement and sophisticated timestep controls, and supports shared memory parallelism based on OpenMP. Independently usable modules provide equation of state, opacity, nuclear reaction rates, and atmosphere boundary conditions. Each module is constructed as a separate Fortran 95 library with its own public interface. Examples include comparisons to other codes and show evolutionary tracks of very low mass stars, brown dwarfs, and gas giant planets; the complete evolution of a 1 Msun star from the pre-main sequence to a cooling white dwarf; the Solar sound speed profile; the evolution of intermediate mass stars through the thermal pulses on the He-shell burning AGB phase; the interior structure of slowly pulsating B Stars and Beta Cepheids; evolutionary tracks of massive stars from the pre-main sequence to the onset of core collapse; stars undergoing Roche lobe overflow; and accretion onto a neutron star.

abstract = {Hot luminous stars show a variety of phenomena in their photospheres and in their winds which still lack clear physical explanations at this time. Among these phenomena are non-thermal line broadening, line profile variability (LPVs), discrete absorption components (DACs), wind clumping and stochastically excited pulsations. Cantiello et al. (2009) argued that a convection zone close to the surface of hot, massive stars, could be responsible for some of these phenomena. This convective zone is caused by a peak in the opacity due to iron recombination and for this reason is referred to as the "iron convection zone" (FeCZ). 3D MHD simulations are used to explore the possible effects of such subsurface convection on the surface properties of hot, massive stars. We argue that turbulence and localized magnetic spots at the surface are the likely consequence of subsurface convection in early type stars.},

abstract = {Magnetic fields have been detected on stars across the H-R diagram and substellar objects either directly by their effect on the formation of spectral lines, or through the activity phenomena they power which can be observed across a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Stars show a very wide variety of magnetic properties in terms of strength, geometry or variability. Cool stars generate their magnetic fields by dynamo effect, and their properties appear to correlate to some extent-with stellar parameters such as mass, rotation and age. With the improvements of instrumentation and data analysis techniques, magnetic fields can now be detected and studied down to the domain of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, triggering new theoretical works aimed, in particular, at modelling dynamo action in these objects. After a brief discussion on the importance of magnetic field in stellar physics, the basics of dynamo theory and magnetic field measurements are presented. The main results stemming from observational and theoretical studies of magnetism are then detailed in two parts: the fully-convective transition, and the very-low mass stars and brown dwarfs domain.},

abstract = {We study the effects of rotation on the structure and evolution of massive stars. The method of Kippenhahn {\&} Thomas (1970) to incorporate the hydrostatic effects of rotation in one dimensional stellar evolutionary codes is strictly valid only in case the angular velocity distribution has a cylindrical symmetry. We demonstrate how this method can be applied (cf. Appendix) in the case where the angular velocity is constant on isobars ("shellular rotation law", cf. Zahn 1992). We also investigate the structural effects of rotation on the stellar atmosphere. The effects of rotational mixing are considered with the theory of Zahn (1992) for the circulation and turbulence in rotating stars. We suppose that the angular momentum in a given shell remains constant with time (asymptotic regime). The subsequent developments brought to the Richardson criterion by Maeder (1995a) and Maeder and Meynet (1996) to account for thermal effects on the shear instability are also applied. Evolutionary tracks are calculated for initial masses of 9, 20, 40 and 60 M with account of the above hydrostatic and mixing effects. The main results are the following ones: 1) The hydrostatic effects alone are quite modest: when the initial angular velocity (Ω) increases from 0 to 90{\%} of the surface critical velocity (Ω crit), the lifetimes of massive star models (40 to 60 M) are increased by 1 to 2{\%}. The evolutionary tracks are shifted towards lower luminosities, making them appear as the ones resulting from slightly lower initial mass stars, typically 0.5 to 2.5 M smaller. 2) Surprisingly we find that the µ−gradients, when non zero, are always strong enough to inhibit mixing. Indeed, the effects of µ-gradients are quite difficult to overcome and this tends to make the rotationally induced mixing inoperant when the Richardson criterion is applied. 3) We suggest that different mixing criteria and/or diffusion coefficients must be searched for and applied if one wants to reproduce the observations by Herrero et al. (1992). Indeed these authors show that above a certain rotational velocity, quite efficient mixing processes are active and able to modify the surface abundances in helium during a fraction of the main sequence lifetime.

MESA can now simultaneously evolve an interacting pair of differentially rotating stars undergoing transfer and loss of mass and angular momentum, greatly enhancing the prior ability to model binary evolution. New MESA capabilities in fully coupled calculation of nuclear networks with hundreds of isotopes now allow MESA to accurately simulate the advanced burning stages needed to construct supernova progenitor models. Implicit hydrodynamics with shocks can now be treated with MESA, enabling modeling of the entire massive star lifecycle, from pre-main-sequence evolution to the onset of core collapse and nucleosynthesis from the resulting explosion. Coupling of the GYRE non-adiabatic pulsation instrument with MESA allows for new explorations of the instability strips for massive stars while also accelerating the astrophysical use of asteroseismology data. We improve the treatment of mass accretion, giving more accurate and robust near-surface profiles. A new MESA capability to calculate weak reaction rates "on-the-fly" from input nuclear data allows better simulation of accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs and the fate of some massive stars. We discuss the ongoing challenge of chemical diffusion in the strongly coupled plasma regime, and exhibit improvements in MESA that now allow for the simulation of radiative levitation of heavy elements in hot stars. We close by noting that the MESA software infrastructure provides bit-for-bit consistency for all results across all the supported platforms, a profound enabling capability for accelerating MESAʼs development.},

An application of the model to high rotation rates leads to a gradual turnover of the X-ray luminosity that is similar to the saturation recently observed in rapidly rotating dwarfs. The resulting angular momentum loss rate, {\_} J J, depends on in the form {\_} J J / , where {\$} 3 for slow rotators and {\$}1.3 for fast rotators. The relation at high rotation rates significantly differs from the power-law exponent for slowly rotating stars, depressing the angular momentum loss rate without necessarily requiring the saturation of the magnetic field.

abstract = {We investigate lithium depletion in standard stellar models (SSMs) and main sequence (MS) open clusters, and explore the origin of the Li dispersion in young, cool stars of equal mass, age and composition. We first demonstrate that SSMs accurately predict the Li abundances of solar analogs at the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) within theoretical uncertainties. We then measure the rate of MS Li depletion by removing the [Fe/H]-dependent ZAMS Li pattern from three well-studied clusters, and comparing the detrended data. MS depletion is found to be mass dependent, in the sense of more depletion at low mass. A dispersion in Li abundance at fixed {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\$} is nearly universal, and sets in by {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 Myr. We discuss mass and age dispersion trends, and the pattern is mixed. We argue that metallicity impacts the ZAMS Li pattern, in agreement with theoretical expectations but contrary to the findings of some previous studies, and suggest Li as a test of cluster metallicity. Finally, we argue that a radius dispersion in stars of fixed mass and age, during the epoch of pre-MS Li destruction, is responsible for the spread in Li abundances and the correlation between rotation and Li in young cool stars, most well known in the Pleiades. We calculate stellar models, inflated to match observed radius anomalies in magnetically active systems, and the resulting range of Li abundances reproduces the observed patterns of young clusters. We discuss ramifications for pre-MS evolutionary tracks and age measurements of young clusters, and suggest an observational test.},

abstract = {Building on results from the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project, this paper shows how a two-parameter classification of massive-star magnetospheres in terms of the magnetic wind confinement (which sets the Alfv$\backslash$'en radius RA) and stellar rotation (which sets the Kepler co-rotation radius RK) provides a useful organisation of both observational signatures and theoretical predictions. We compile the first comprehensive study of inferred and observed values for relevant stellar and magnetic parameters of 64 confirmed magnetic OB stars with Teff {\textgreater} 16 kK. Using these parameters, we locate the stars in the magnetic confinement-rotation diagram, a log-log plot of RK vs. RA. This diagram can be subdivided into regimes of centrifugal magnetospheres (CM), with RA {\textgreater} RK, vs. dynamical magnetospheres (DM), with RK {\textgreater} RA. We show how key observational diagnostics, like the presence and characteristics of Halpha emission, depend on a star's position within the diagram, as well as other parameters, especially the expected wind mass-loss rates. In particular, we identify two distinct populations of magnetic stars with Halpha emission: namely, slowly rotating O-type stars with narrow emission consistent with a DM, and more rapidly rotating B-type stars with broader emission associated with a CM. For O-type stars, the high mass-loss rates are sufficient to accumulate enough material for line emission even within the relatively short free-fall timescale associated with a DM: this high mass-loss rate also leads to a rapid magnetic spindown of the stellar rotation. For the B-type stars, the longer confinement of a CM is required to accumulate sufficient emitting material from their relatively weak winds, which also lead to much longer spindown timescales.

abstract = {We compare the current effects of rotation in stellar evolution to those of the magnetic field created by the Tayler instability. In stellar regions, where magnetic field can be generated by the dynamo due to differential rotation (Spruit 2002), we find that the growth rate of the magnetic instability is much faster than for the thermal instability. Thus, meridional circulation is negligible with respect to the magnetic fields, both for the transport of angular momentum and of chemical elements. Also, the horizontal coupling by the magnetic field, which reaches values of a few 10 5 G, is much more important than the effects of the horizontal turbulence. The field, however, is not sufficient to distort the shape of the equipotentials. We impose the condition that the energy of the magnetic field created by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo cannot be larger than the energy excess present in the differential rotation. This leads to a criterion for the existence of the magnetic field in stellar interiors. Numerical tests are made in a rotating star model of 15 M⊙ rotating with an initial velocity of 300 km{\textperiodcentered}s −1. We find that the coefficients of diffusion for the transport of angular momentum by the magnetic field are several orders of magnitude larger than the transport coefficients for meridional circulation and shear mixing. The same applies to the diffusion coefficients for the chemical elements, however very close to the core, the strong µ-gradient reduces the mixing by the magnetic instability to values not too different from the case without magnetic field. We also find that magnetic instability is present throughout the radiative envelope, with the exception of the very outer layers, where differential rotation is insufficient to build the field, a fact consistent with the lack of evidence of strong fields at the surface of massive stars.},

Each sequence was begun with a (typical) equatorial rotational velocity of 210 km s-1. On the main sequence, the effects of rotation are of minor importance. However, as the core contracts during later stages, important effects arise in all physically plausible cases. The outer regions of the cores approach critical velocities and develop unstable angular velocity distributions.

Our sample consists of 104 magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequence objects (1 Myr t 10 Gyr). For non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find that the unsigned average large-scale surface field |B V || is related to age as t −0.655±0.045. This relation has a similar dependence to that identified by Skumanich (1972), used as the basis for gyrochronology. Likewise, our relation could be used as an age-dating method ("magnetochronology"). The trends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism are consistent with the trends found from Zeeman broadening measurements (sensitive to large-and small-scale fields). These similarities indicate that the fields recovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting that small-and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generation processes. For the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relations are found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux $\Phi$ V and P rot. We attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction, rather than being driven by the dynamo.},

abstract = {Calculations have been performed for the evolution of rotating stars with realistic, time-dependent redistribution of angular momentum and chemical composition due to gas-dynamical instabilities. Convection and Eddington circulation are found to be the most important mechanisms for changing the angular momentum distribution, while the dynamical shear and Solberg-Hoiland instabilities produce chemical mixing in regions which remain unmixed in nonrotating calculations. The calculations indicate that ignoring the finite time scales associated with angular momentum redistribution is a poor and, often, misleading approximation. The primary results of the calculations are: (1) evolved stellar cores develop nonaxisymmetric instabilities corresponding to the bifurcation of the Maclaurin sequence before they reach critical (Keplerian) rotational velocities; (2) for the 7 M{\textcopyright} star, the instability point is reached prior to carbon ignition, indicating that catastrophic carbon detonation may be avoided by rotating stars; (3) the hydrodynamic events associated with violent stellar death will generally involve rapidly rotating, triaxial or fissioning cores. In addition to radically altering the nature of these events, this indicates that stellar collapse may be a strong source of gravitational wave radiation.},

abstract = {We further develop the Tayler-Spruit dynamo theory, based on the most efficient instability for generating magnetic fields in radiative layers of differentially rotating stars. We avoid the simplifying assumptions that either the µ-or the T-gradient dominates, but we treat the general case and we also account for the nonadiabatic effects, which favour the growth of the magnetic field. The general equation leads to the same analytical solutions in the limiting cases considered by Spruit (2002). Numerical models of a 15 M star with a magnetic field are performed. The differences between the asymptotic solutions and the general solution demonstrate the need to use the general solution. Stars with a magnetic field rotate almost as a solid body. Several of their properties (size of the core, MS lifetimes, tracks, abundances) are closer to those of models without rotation than with rotation only. In particular, the observed N/C or N/H excesses in OB stars are better explained by our previous models with rotation only than by the present models with magnetic fields that predict no nitrogen excesses. We show that there is a complex feedback loop between the magnetic instability and the thermal instability driving meridional circulation. Equilibrium of the loop, with a small amount of differential rotation, can be reached when the velocity U magn of the growth of the magnetic instability is of the same order as the velocity U circ of the meridional circulation. This opens the possibility for further magnetic models, but at this stage we do not know the relative importance of the magnetic fields due to the Tayler instability in stellar interiors.},

abstract = {The study of lithium (Li) surface abundance in the Sun and young stellar globular clusters which are seemingly anomalous in present-day scenarios, as well as the influence of rotation and magnetic braking (MB) on its depletion during pre-main sequence (PMS) and main sequence (MS). In this work, the effects of rotational mixing and of the rotational hydrostatic effects on Li abundances are studied by simulating several grids of PMS and MS rotating and non-rotating models. Those effects are combined with the additional impact of the MB (with magnetic field intensities ranging between 3.0 and 5.0 G). The data obtained from simulations are confronted by comparing different stellar parameters. The results show that the surface Li abundance for the Sun like models at the end of the PMS and throughout the MS decreases when rotational effects are included, i.e. the Li depletion rate for rotating models is higher than for non-rotating ones. This effect is attenuated when the MB produced by a magnetic field is present. This physical phenomena impacts also the star effective temperature ({\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}}{\$}) and its location in the HR diagram. The impact of MB in Li depletion is sensitive to the magnetic field intensity: the higher it is, the lower the Li destruction. A direct link between the magnetic fields and the convective zone (CZ) size is observed: stronger magnetic fields produce shallower CZ's. This result suggests that MB effect must be taken into consideration during PMS if we aim to reproduce Li abundances in young clusters.},

abstract = {Using data from the Hungarian-made Automated Telescope Network (HATNet) survey for transiting exoplanets, we measure photometric rotation periods for 368 Pleiades stars with 0.4 ≤M≤ 1.3. M.. We detect periodic variability for 74 per cent of the cluster members in this mass range that are within our field-of-view, and 93 per cent of the members with 0.7 ≤M≤ 1.0 M.. This increases, by a factor of 5, the number of Pleiades members with measured periods. We compare these data to the rich sample of spectroscopically determined projected equatorial rotation velocities (v sin i) available in the literature for this cluster. Included in our sample are 14 newly identified probable cluster members which have proper motions, photometry and rotation periods consistent with membership. For stars with M≤ 0.85 M. the rotation periods, v sin i and radius estimates are consistent with the stars having an isotropic distribution of rotation axes, if a moderate differential rotation law is assumed. For stars with M≤ 0.85 M., the inferred sin i values are systematically larger than 1.0. These observations imply that the combination of measured parameters P(v sin i)/R is too large by {\~{}} 24 per cent for low-mass stars in this cluster. By comparing our new mass-period relation for the Pleiades to the slightly older cluster M35, we confirm previous indications that the spin-down stalls at {\~{}} 100 Myr for the slowest rotating stars with 0.7 ≤M≤ 1.1 M.- a fact which may indicate that the internal transport of angular momentum is inefficient in slowly rotating solar-mass stars. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {The basic mechanisms responsible for producing winds from cool, late-type stars are still largely unknown. We take inspiration from recent progress in understanding solar wind acceleration to develop a physically motivated model of the time-steady mass loss rates of cool main-sequence stars and evolved giants. This model follows the energy flux of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from a subsurface convection zone to its eventual dissipation and escape through open magnetic flux tubes. We show how Alfv{\'{e}}n waves and turbulence can produce winds in either a hot corona or a cool extended chromosphere, and we specify the conditions that determine whether or not coronal heating occurs. These models do not utilize arbitrary normalization factors, but instead predict the mass loss rate directly from a star's fundamental properties. We take account of stellar magnetic activity by extending standard age-activity-rotation indicators to include the evolution of the filling factor of strong photospheric magnetic fields. We compared the predicted mass loss rates with observed values for 47 stars and found significantly better agreement than was obtained from the popular scaling laws of Reimers, Schr{\"{o}}der, and Cuntz. The algorithm used to compute cool-star mass loss rates is provided as a self-contained and efficient computer code. We anticipate that the results from this kind of model can be incorporated straightforwardly into stellar evolution calculations and population synthesis techniques. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We developed angular momentum evolution models for 0.5 and 0.8 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} stars. The parametric models include a new wind braking law based on recent numerical simulations of magnetised stellar winds, specific dynamo and mass-loss rate prescriptions, as well as core/envelope decoupling. We compare model predictions to the distributions of rotational periods measured for low mass stars belonging to star forming regions and young open clusters. Furthermore, we explore the mass dependence of model parameters by comparing these new models to the solar-mass models we developed earlier. Rotational evolution models are computed for slow, median, and fast rotators at each stellar mass. The models reproduce reasonably well the rotational behaviour of low-mass stars between 1 Myr and 8-10 Gyr, including pre-main sequence to zero-age main sequence spin up, prompt zero-age main sequence spin down, and early-main sequence convergence of the surface rotation rates. Fast rotators are found to have systematically shorter disk lifetimes than moderate and slow rotators, thus enabling dramatic pre-main sequence spin up. They also have shorter core-envelope coupling timescales, i.e., more uniform internal rotation. As to the mass dependence, lower mass stars require significantly longer core-envelope coupling timescale than solar-type ones, which results in strong differential rotation developing in the stellar interior on the early main sequence. Lower mass stars also require a weaker braking torque to account for their longer spin down timescale on the early main sequence, while they ultimately converge towards lower rotational velocities than solar-type stars on the longer term due to their reduced moment of inertia. We also find evidence that the mass-dependence of the wind braking efficiency may be related to a change of the magnetic topology in lower mass stars.},

We used five clusters observed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO Survey that span the age range ∼10−100 Myr, in which these effects could be important.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO Survey radial velocities were combined with astrometry from {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 to obtain clean lists of high-probability members for the five clusters. A Bayesian maximum likelihood method was adopted to fit the observed cluster sequences to theoretical predictions to derive the best model parameters and the cluster reddening and age.

We obtained ages of 18 Myr and 21 Myr for Gamma Vel A and B, respectively, and Myr for 25 Ori. However, a single isochrone is not sufficient to account for the lithium dispersion, and an increasing level of spot coverage as mass decreases seems to be required. On the other hand, the older clusters (NGC 2451 B at 30 Myr, NGC 2547 at 35 Myr, and NGC 2516 at 138 Myr) are consistent with standard models (i.e. {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ML{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 2.0 and no spots) except at low masses: a 20{\%} spot coverage appears to reproduce the sequence of M-type stars better and might explain the observed spread in lithium abundances.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The quality of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO data combined with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} allows us to gain important insights on pre-main-sequence evolution.

The {\textless}sup{\textgreater}7{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Li behaviour and its evolution with time is well reproduced for G-type stars. However, the ability of the model to reproduce the so-called {\textless}sup{\textgreater}7{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}Li dip centred around ∼6600 K strongly depends on the adopted prescriptions for shear turbulence. It also requires a stellar mass dependence for the parametric viscosity adopted for the transport of angular momentum, similar to the behaviour predicted for the generation and luminosity of internal gravity waves generated by stellar convective envelopes. Finally, the model predicts internal rotation profiles in good agreement with asteroseismic constraints in main sequence stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We provide an efficient way to model G-type stars of different ages and metallicities successfully.

abstract = {Gaia-ESO is a large public spectroscopic survey carried out with FLAMES, targeting 114324 stars, systematically covering all major components of the Milky Way, from halo to star-forming regions, providing the first homogeneous overview of the distributions of kinematics and elemental abundances. This alone is revolutionising our knowledge of Galactic and stellar evolution: when combined with Gaia astrometry the survey quantifies the formation history and evolution of young, mature and ancient Galactic populations. With well-defined samples, we have observed the bulge, thick and thin discs and halo components, and open star clusters of all ages and masses. The UVES and GIRAFFE spectra have: quantified individual elemental abundances in each star; yielded precise radial velocities for a 4-D kinematic phase-space; mapped kinematic gradients and abundance; followed the formation, evolution and dissolution of open clusters as they populate the disc and provided a legacy dataset that adds enormous value to the Gaia mission and ongoing ESO surveys. Overview of the observations This is the last release of the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES) and include all the astrophysical parameters derived from the observations carried out between December 2011 and January 2018. These include Milky Way field observations, Open Cluster observations, and calibration observations of different targets, such as radial velocity standard stars, benchmark stars, globular clusters, COROT and Kepler 2 red giants and more (see Pancino et al. 2017, A{\&}A, 589, A5). There are also included astrophysical parameters derived from complementary observations extracted from the ESO archive and processed with the GES pipelines. These encompass mostly cluster observations retrieved to benefit both science and calibrations as well as some bulge observations and are denoted by use of the prefix 'AR' rather than 'GE' in the GES{\_}TYPE header keyword of the spectra. See Table 1 for a list of GES{\_}TYPEs and the corresponding field types. Figure 1 shows the location of the fields on the sky.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the early installment of the third {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A summary of the contents of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 and an overview of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 results.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 34 months of the mission have been processed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision, accuracy, and homogeneity. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the ({\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} − {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) colour are also available. The passbands for {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the 7 million radial velocities from {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 are included in this release, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will appear as part of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3. Finally, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 represents an updated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as that for {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will not change for {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR3.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} EDR3 represents a significant advance over {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30–40{\%} for the parallaxes and by a factor {\~{}}2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1{\%} level},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We present the second {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} A summary of the contents of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 results.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The raw data collected with the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater} for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (330–680 nm) and {\textless}i{\textgreater}G{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}RP{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} (630–1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 represents a major achievement for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. Aims. A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. Methods. The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. Results. Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of ∼3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr-1 for the proper motions. A systematic component of ∼0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of ∼94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr-1. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is ∼10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to ∼0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. Conclusions. Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

abstract = {We present the third data release of the European Space Agency's Gaia
mission, GDR3. The GDR3 catalogue is the outcome of the processing of raw data
collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission
by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium. The GDR3 catalogue
contains the same source list, celestial positions, proper motions, parallaxes,
and broad band photometry in the G, G{\$}{\_}{\{}BP{\}}{\$}, and G{\$}{\_}{\{}RP{\}}{\$} pass-bands already
present in the Early Third Data Release. GDR3 introduces an impressive wealth
of new data products. More than 33 million objects in the ranges {\$}G{\_}{\{}rvs{\}} {\textless} 14{\$}
and {\$}3100 {\textless}T{\_}{\{}eff{\}} {\textless}14500 {\$}, have new determinations of their mean radial
velocities based on data collected by Gaia. We provide G{\$}{\_}{\{}rvs{\}}{\$} magnitudes for
most sources with radial velocities, and a line broadening parameter is listed
for a subset of these. Mean Gaia spectra are made available to the community.
The GDR3 catalogue includes about 1 million mean spectra from the radial
velocity spectrometer, and about 220 million low-resolution blue and red prism
photometer BPRP mean spectra. The results of the analysis of epoch photometry
are provided for some 10 million sources across 24 variability types. GDR3
includes astrophysical parameters and source class probabilities for about 470
million and 1500 million sources, respectively, including stars, galaxies, and
quasars. Orbital elements and trend parameters are provided for some {\$}800\backslash,000{\$}
astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries. More than {\$}150\backslash,000{\$} Solar
System objects, including new discoveries, with preliminary orbital solutions
and individual epoch observations are part of this release. Reflectance spectra
derived from the epoch BPRP spectral data are published for about 60$\backslash$,000
asteroids. Finally, an additional data set is provided, namely the Gaia
Andromeda Photometric Survey (abridged)},

Starting with the expected performance , it shows how the combined and repeated information on each source will lead to a giant leap in our current knowledge of stellar and galactic physics, resulting both from the accuracy on individual objects and from the statistical exploitation of the unbiased census of over one billion stars. Attention is drawn to the additional science output of the mission, including the detection of extra-solar planetary systems, the determination of thousands of stellar masses, the massive impact on Solar System studies, and the direct realisation of the primary inertial frame in the visible.},

abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO Survey (GES) is a public, high-resolution spectroscopic survey, conducted with the multi-object spectrograph Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) on the Very Large Telescope (European Southern Observatory, ESO, Cerro Paranal, Chile) from December 2011 to January 2018. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO has targeted all the main stellar components of the Milky Way, including thin and thick disc, bulge, and halo. In particular, a large sample of open clusters has been observed, from very young ones, just out of the embedded phase, to very old ones.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The different kinds of clusters and stars targeted in them are useful to reach the main science goals of the open cluster part of GES, which are the study of the open cluster structure and dynamics, the use of open clusters to constrain and improve stellar evolution models, and the definition of Galactic disc properties (e.g., metallicity distribution).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-ESO Survey is organised in 19 working groups (WGs), each one being responsible for a task. We describe here the work of three of them, one in charge of the selection of the targets within each cluster or association (WG4), one responsible for defining the most probable candidate member stars (WG1), and another one in charge of the preparation of the observations (WG6). As the entire GES has been conducted before the second {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data release, we could not make use of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} astrometry to define cluster member candidates. We made use of public and private photometry to select the stars to be observed with FLAMES, once brought on a common astrometric system (the one defined by 2MASS). Candidate target selection was based on ground-based proper motions, radial velocities, and X-ray properties when appropriate, for example, and it was mostly used to define the position of the clusters' evolutionary sequences in the colour-magnitude diagrams. Targets for GIRAFFE were then selected near the sequences in an unbiased way. We used known information on membership, when available, only for the few stars to be observed with UVES.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We collected spectra for 62 confirmed clusters in the main observing campaign (and a few more clusters were taken from the ESO archive). Among them are very young clusters, where the main targets are pre-main sequence stars, clusters with very hot and massive stars currently on the main sequence, intermediate-age and old clusters where evolved stars are the main targets. Our strategy of making the selection of targets as inclusive and unbiased as possible and of observing a significant and representative fraction of all possible targets permitted us to collect the largest, most accurate, and most homogeneous spectroscopic data set on open star clusters ever achieved.},

Finding possible solar siblings is difficult since they are spread widely throughout the Galaxy.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We search for solar sibling candidates in AMBRE, the very large spectra database of solar vicinity stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Since the ages and chemical abundances of solar siblings are very similar to those of the Sun, we carried out a chemistry- and age-based search for solar sibling candidates. We used high-resolution spectra to derive precise stellar parameters and chemical abundances of the stars. We used these spectroscopic parameters together with {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} DR2 astrometric data to derive stellar isochronal ages. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Gaia{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data were also used to study the kinematics of the sibling candidates.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} From about 17 000 stars that are characterized within the AMBRE project, we first selected 55 stars whose metallicities are closest to the solar value (−0.1 ≤ [Fe/H] ≤ 0.1 dex). For these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\alpha${\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and neutron-capture elements, based on which we selected 12 solar sibling candidates with average abundances and metallicities between −0.03 and 0.03 dex. Our further selection left us with four candidates with stellar ages that are compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the two of the hottest candidates, we derived the carbon isotopic ratios, which are compatible with the solar value. HD 186302 is the most precisely characterized and probably the most probable candidate of our four best candidates.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Very precise chemical characterization and age estimation is necessary to identify solar siblings. We propose that in addition to typical chemical tagging, the study of isotopic ratios can give further important information about the relation of sibling candidates with the Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic age determinations of the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise isochronal ages.},

@article{Gossage2021,
abstract = { Two magnetic braking models are implemented in MESA for use in the MIST stellar model grids. Stars less than about 1.3 solar masses are observed to spin down over time through interaction with their magnetized stellar winds (i.e., magnetic braking). This is the basis for gyrochronology and is fundamental to the evolution of lower-mass stars. The detailed physics behind magnetic braking are uncertain, as are 1D stellar evolution models. Thus, we calibrate our models and compare to data from open clusters. Each braking model tested here is capable of reproducing aspects of the data, with important distinctions; neither fully accounts for the observations. The Matt et al. prescription matches the slowly rotating stars observed in open clusters but tends to overestimate the presence of rapidly rotating stars. The Garraffo et al. prescription often produces too much angular momentum loss to accurately match the observed slow sequence for lower-mass stars but reproduces the bimodal nature of slowly and rapidly rotating stars observed in open clusters fairly well. Our models additionally do not reproduce the observed solar lithium depletion, corroborating previous findings that effects other than rotation may be important. We find additional evidence that some level of mass dependency may be missing in these braking models to match the rotation periods observed in clusters older than 1 Gyr better. },

   abstract = {We use two-dimensional axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations to compute steady-state solutions for solar-like stellar winds from rotating stars with dipolar magnetic fields. Our parameter study includes 50 simulations covering a wide range of relative magnetic field strengths and rotation rates, extending from the slow- and approaching the fast-magnetic-rotator regimes. Using the simulations to compute the angular momentum loss, we derive a semi-analytic formulation for the external torque on the star that fits all of the simulations to a precision of a few percent. This formula provides a simple method for computing the magnetic braking of Sun-like stars due to magnetized stellar winds, which properly includes the dependence on the strength of the magnetic field, mass loss rate, stellar radius, surface gravity, and spin rate, and which is valid for both slow and fast rotators. © 2012.

   abstract = {Context. Space observations by the CoRoT and Kepler missions have provided a wealth of high-quality seismic data for a large number of stars from the main sequence to the red giant phases. One main goal of these missions is to take advantage of the rich spectra of solar-like oscillations to perform precise determinations of stellar characteristic parameters. To make the best of such data, we need theoretical stellar models with a precise near-surface structure since a near-surface structure of a solar-like star has significant influence on solar-like oscillation frequencies. The mixing-length parameter is a key factor to determine the near-surface structure of stellar models. In current versions of the convection formulations used in stellar evolution codes, the mixing-length parameter is a free parameter that needs to be properly specified. Aims. We aim at determining appropriate values of the mixing-length parameter, α, to be used consistently with the adopted convection formulation when computing stellar evolution models across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This determination is based on 3D hydrodynamical simulation models. Methods. We calibrated α values by matching entropy profiles of 1D envelope models with those of hydrodynamical 3D models of solar-like stars produced by the CO 5 BOLD code. For such calibration, previous works concentrated on the classical mixing-length theory (MLT). We also analyzed full spectrum turbulence (FST) models. To construct the atmosphere in the 1D models, we used the Eddington gray T(τ) relation and that with the solar-calibrated Hopf-like function. Results. For both MLT and FST models with a mixing length lâ€., =â€., αH p , calibrated α values increase with increasing surface gravity or decreasing effective temperature. For the FST models, we carried out an additional calibration using an α ∗ value defined as lâ€., =â€., r top â€ -â€ râ€ +â€ α ∗ H p,â€† top , where α ∗ is found to increase with surface gravity and effective temperature. We provide tables of the calibrated α values across the T eff -log g plane for solar metallicity. By computing stellar evolution with varying α based on our 3D α calibration, we find that the change from solar α to varying α shifts evolutionary tracks particularly for the FST model. As for the correspondence to the 3D models, the solar Hopf-like function generally gives a photospheric-minimum entropy closer to a 3D model than the Eddington T(τ). The structure below the photosphere depends on the adopted convection model. However, we cannot obtain a definitive conclusion about which convection model gives the best correspondence to the 3D models. This is because each 1D physical quantity is related via an equation of state (EoS), but it is not the case for the averaged 3D quantities. Although the FST models with l = r top -+α ∗ H p top are found to give the oscillation frequencies closest to the solar observed frequencies, their acoustic cavities are formed with compensatory effects between deviating density and temperature profiles near the top of the convective envelope. In future work, an appropriate treatment of the top part of the 1D convective envelope is necessary, for example, by considering turbulent pressure and overshooting.},

   abstract = {Stellar convection is customarily described by Mixing-Length Theory, which makes use of the mixing-length scale to express the convective flux, velocity, and temperature gradients of the convective elements and stellar medium. The mixing-length scale is taken to be proportional to the local pressure scale height, and the proportionality factor (the mixing-length parameter) must be determined by comparing the stellar models to some calibrator, usually the Sun. No strong arguments exist to suggest that the mixing-length parameter is the same in all stars and at all evolutionary phases. The aim of this study is to present a new theory of stellar convection that does not require the mixing length parameter. We present a self-consistent analytical formulation of stellar convection that determines the properties of stellar convection as a function of the physical behaviour of the convective elements themselves and of the surrounding medium. This new theory is formulated starting from a conventional solution of the Navier-Stokes/Euler equations, i.e. the Bernoulli equation for a perfect fluid, but expressed in a non-inertial reference frame co-moving with the convective elements. In our formalism the motion of stellar convective cells inside convectively-unstable layers is fully determined by a new system of equations for convection in a non-local and time-dependent formalism. We obtain an analytical, non-local, time-dependent sub-sonic solution for the convective energy transport that does not depend on any free parameter. The theory is suitable for the outer convective zones of solar type stars and stars of all mass on the main sequence band. The predictions of the new theory are compared with those from the standard mixing-length paradigm for the most accurate calibrator, the Sun, with very satisfactory results.},
